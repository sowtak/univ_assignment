"I should think so indeed," replied Dete with animation; "he was at one time the owner of one of the largest farms in Domleschg, where my mother used to live.
But he drank and gambled away the whole of his property, and when this became known to his mother and father they died of sorrow, one shortly after the other.
Uncle, having nothing left to him but his bad name, disappeared and it was heard that he had gone to Naples as a soldier.
After twelve or fifteen years he reappeared in Domleschg, bringing with him a young son whom he tried to place with some of his kinspeople.
Every door, however, was shut in his face, for no one wished to have any more to do with him.
Embittered by this treatment, he vowed never to set foot in Domleschg again, and he then came to Doerfli where he lived with his little boy.
His wife, it seemed, had died shortly after the child's birth.
He must have accumulated some money during his absence, for he apprenticed his son Tobias to a carpenter.
He was a steady lad, and kindly received by every one in Doerfli.
His father, however, was still looked upon with suspicion, and it was even rumored that he had killed a man in some brawl at Naples."
